# Github-Collab-Project


Purpose of the Repository

This repository was created to demonstrate basic Git and GitHub collaboration workflows as part of the ITE 1100 course. It showcases how to create branches, add files, commit changes, and submit a pull request using Git Bash and GitHub.

Steps Followed
1. Created a local project folder and initialized it with `git init`.
2. Created a Python file (`Github_Tutorial_Project.py`) containing group member names and a print function.
3. Created a new branch (`ProjectFinal`) using `git checkout -b`.
4. Added and committed the file with `git add` and `git commit`.
5. Connected the local repository to GitHub using `git remote add origin`.
6. Pushed the branch to GitHub using `git push -u origin ProjectFinal`.
7. Submitted a pull request from `ProjectFinal` to `main` on GitHub.
